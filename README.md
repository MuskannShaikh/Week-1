# Week-1 to Week-3
<h3>Crop Production and Fertilizer Prediction Dataset is preprocessed and data visualisation is performed to gain insights.</h3>
<br>
<li><b>Crop production dataset has various columns such as 'N', 'P', 'K', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'ph', 'rainfall', 'label'.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>Fertilizer Prediction dataset has various columns such as 'Temparature', 'Humidity', 'Moisture', 'Soil Type', 'Crop Type', 'Nitrogen', 'Potassium', 'Phosphorous', 'fert_no'.</b></li>

  <br>
<p>I have collected and analyzed agricultural dataset for crop production containing soil parameters (N, P, K values), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall and similarly for fertilizers prediction dataser containing soil parameters (N, P, K values), Temparature, Humidity, Moisture, Soil Type, Crop Type .
<br>I have performed data preprocessing, handling missing values and checking for duplicates.
<br>I have used exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize correlations between features and crop recommendations.
<br>I have implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the best crop for given soil and climate conditions.
<br>I have also evaluated the model's accuracy</p>
